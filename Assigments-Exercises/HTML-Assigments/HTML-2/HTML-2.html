    <h1>Kristel Quisado | BSIT 2-2 (PUPQC)</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kristel Quisado, an IT student whoâ€™s passionate about digital design, development, and all things creative. I'm currently a member of several school orgs and love being hands-on with projects and tech events.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me making beaded accessories for my small business, creating layouts for school orgs, or hanging out with friends and family (especially my cute nephew!).</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>One of my biggest goals is to become a skilled full-stack developer and help bring meaningful, user-friendly systems to life. I also want to inspire others, especially women in tech, to chase their dreams fearlessly.</p>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>I debug my life like a QA tester... except with snacks and iced coffee on standby.</p>
